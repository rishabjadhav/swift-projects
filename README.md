# swift-projects

This repository contains my Swift projects from the 2022-2023 school year. Swift is an Apple developed programming language used to develop applications.
I coded these projects in my senior year of high school. This was my first year learning and coding in Swift.

Course Description:

Students will apply previously learned object-oriented programming techniques and rules of inheritance (super/sub classes, abstract classes, and interfaces) to Apple’s iOS API’s. Because of the dynamic nature of development for mobile devices, students will need to be independent learners;
most apps will require significant research to complete, and students will work independently for most of the year. Significant group projects will expose students to the challenges of working in teams and develop project management & interpersonal skills. Students will code in the Swift programming
language using the Xcode IDE, building apps for devices such as iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. Additionally, students will analyze the responsibility of software professionals regarding issues of the environment, ethics, health, safety, and diversity in society and in the workplace.
